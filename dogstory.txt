Panel 1:

(A fluffy white dog named Max is sitting on the couch, looking bored. Suddenly, he notices a strange glow emanating from his paws.)

Max: (excitedly) Woah, what's happening?!

(Max's paws start to glow brighter and brighter, and he starts to feel a strange energy coursing through his body.)

Panel 2:

(Max's paws are now glowing bright blue, and he's floating off the ground. He looks around in amazement.)

Max: (excitedly) I have superpowers! I can fly and shoot laser beams from my paws!

(Max starts to fly around the room, barking happily. The glow from his paws fades away, but he's still floating in mid-air.)

Max: (to himself) This is the best day ever!
